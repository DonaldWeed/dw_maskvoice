# dw_maskvoice

**dw_maskvoice** is a lightweight FiveM script that applies a realistic voice distortion
when a player is wearing a mask.

The script uses native Mumble audio submixes to slightly muffle and filter voices,
improving immersion and roleplay quality without any UI or framework dependencies.
